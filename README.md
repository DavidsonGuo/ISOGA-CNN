# ISOGA-CNN
This project comprises a spectral dataset and the ISOGA-CNN code
Hi. In this code, a novel uniform manifold approximation and projection combined-improved simultaneous optimization genetic algorithm-convolutional neural network (UMAP-ISOGA-CNN) algorithm was proposed. 
The improved simultaneous optimization genetic algorithm (ISOGA) combined with convolutional neural network (CNN) to optimize the architecture, hyperparameters, and optimizer of the CNN model simultaneously. 
Additionally, a uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) method was used to visualize the feature space of all feature layers of the ISOGA-CNN model.
The UMAP-ISOGA-CNN algorithm combined with visible and near-infrared hyperspectral imaging was used to identify peanut kernels contaminated with Aspergillus flavus and to distinguish their storage time, which is essential for the food industry to monitor the freshness of products. 
Overall, the UMAP-ISOGA-CNN algorithm provides useful insights into the feature space of the ISOGA-CNN model, contributing to a better understanding of the modelâ€™s internal mechanisms.
